## country_example

see more information in the README.md into the country_example folder = ![country example](https://github.com/stormalf/nodejs-ibmi-examples/tree/main/country_example)

This first example is about a small CRUD application that stores country id and description in a database.
It uses node-jt400 to connect to the database and for now a .env file is used to store the credentials.
